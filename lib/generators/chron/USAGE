Description:
    Declaratively supply a block of code to be fired for a resource at a given datetime column on that model.

    This generator takes care of adding the block declaration and the db columns.

Example:
    rails generate chron:observation my_model my_timestamp

    rails g chron:observation auction close_at

    This will create:
        db/migrations/add_chron_observation_timestamps_for_close_at_to_auctions.rb

    And will modify:
        app/models/auction.rb by inserting the `at_time :close_at do;end` block and including `Chron::Observable` if needed

    Now you could add code that does anything for that object at that given time in the background.
